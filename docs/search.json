The first 10,000 are listed in the table below\nOriginal Table\n\n\n\n\nGross Quality Check: Percent of blank values in each column\n\n\n\n\nArtists and Artworks\n13,736 artists have works of art attributed to them in the MoMa dataset. Note that this number is fewer than the number of artists in the artists spreadsheet.\nOver 50% of artists have a single work of artwork in the MoMA.\nThe top 1% of account for 41% of artworks in the MoMA.\nPercentiles: Works per Artist\n\n  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  95%  99% 100% \n   1    1    1    1    1    1    2    3    6   16   34  144 5050 \n\n\n\n\nDates of Artwork: Requires Cleaning\nMost works of art have dates. These, however, sometimes have more information than just a 4 digit year (e.g. c. 1930, 1930-32, after 1930, 1930, published 1932.). Simplification of this field will be required before further analysis.\n\n\n\nClassifications of Artworks\nThere are 36 classifications of works of art. Most classifications are based on medium, with the exception of Frank Llloyd Wright Archive.\nOnly 1 work of art has no classification. 678 works of art are noted as “not assigned”.\n\n\n\nMedia: An Unwieldy Category\nThere are 21,641 distinct classes of media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Lines\nThere are over 7200 distinct Credit Lines.\nThese include Credit Lines such as “Gift of the artist” which, though they are the same in the data, indicate more than one real-life donor. “Purchase” is another common Credit Line that does not indicate a real life donor. 17% of works belong to such credit lines.\nRoughly 1% of works do not have a credit line given in the dataset.\n\n\n\nOf the credit lines that do point to individual donors (henceforth individual credit lines), the majority have only\na single work in the museum. The list of percentiles below show that fewer than 50%\nof individual credit lines have more than 1 work, and only 10% of individual credit lines have more than 17 works.\nThe top 10% of individual credit lines are responsible for 10% for 65% of works in the MoMA.\nPercentiles: Works per Credit Line\n\n   0%   10%   20%   30%   40%   50%   60%   70%   80%   90%   95%   99%  100% \n    1     1     1     1     1     1     2     3     6    17    38   199 11256 \n\nMost credit lines are only “active” for one year. The length of time for which a credit line is active\nis a measure obtained by subtracting the year in which the credit line’s last work was acquired\nfrom the year in which the credit line’s first work was acquired, then adding 1.\nThe list below gives percentiles for the number of years for which a credit line is active.\nPercentiles: Years Active for all Credit Lines\n\n  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  95%  99% 100% \n   1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    7   17   39   85 \n\nCredit lines that have more works in the museum also tend to be credit lines that have longer lifespans.\nPercentiles: Years Active for the 10% of Credit Lines with the Most Works\n\n  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  95%  99% 100% \n   1    1    1    1    2    5    9   14   21   32   41   76   85 \n\n\n# A tibble: 5,765 × 2\n   CreditLine number\n   <chr>       <int>\n 1 gift        81998\n 2 collection  31202\n 3 fund        26611\n 4 artist      11783\n 5 stern       11471\n 6 louis       11296\n 7 purchase    10921\n 8 foundation  10075\n 9 through      7600\n10 acquired     6503\n# ℹ 5,755 more rows\n# A tibble: 30,729 × 1\n   CreditLine                                                         \n   <chr>                                                              \n 1 Gift of Daniel Morris and Denis Gallion, Historical Design Collect…\n 2 Gift of Daniel Morris and Denis Gallion, Historical Design Collect…\n 3 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n 4 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n 5 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n 6 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n 7 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n 8 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n 9 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n10 David Whitney Collection, Gift of David Whitney                    \n# ℹ 30,719 more rows\n\n\n\n\n",

These data,\nanalyzed in the figures below, give insight into the curatorial teams that make up\nMoMA exhibitions.\nA. Roles in Exhibitions\nThe data are said to record all known participants in Exhibitions. The most common\ntype of participant in Exhibitions is the “Artist.” After these, there\nare six other roles into which MoMA classifies participants. All the roles, excluding\nartist, into which MoMA classifies participants are displayed with their frequency\nin the figure below.\n\n\n\nThe data also record a more detailed role, namely, the “Exhibition Role in Press\nRelease.” There, curators and other participants may take on more specific titles,\nsome of the most common of which include “Director”, “Selector”, or “Organizer.”\n\n\n\nThe table and the figures below both describe the times when different Press Release\nroles for Curators were in use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Number of Participants per Exhibition\nMost exhibitions have small teams. Indeed, most exhibitions only have a single non-Artist\nparticipant, the Curator. The figures below describe, first, how many non-artist participants\nexhibitions tended to have throughout the decades, and, second, how many curators they\ntended to have.\n\n\n\nC. Number of Exhibitions per Curator\nIn the data, there are 320 unique curators involved in all the exhibitions from 1929-1989.\nThe figures below characterize individual curators by the number of exhibitions in which\neach has been involved. In general, the majority of curators have only been involved with a single\nexhibition, whereas the top 5% of most exhibited curators have exhibited about 47.7% percent of the time.\nIn the figures below, there are decile values for the number of exhibition for each curator. Below that, the share of the top 5% is calculated for each score.\nCurator Percentiles for Number of Exhibitions per Curator for All Years:\n\n  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  95%  99% 100% \n   1    1    1    1    1    1    1    2    5   10   18   61   94 \n\n\n[1] \"The top 5% of all curators were exhibited 48% of the time.\"\n\n\n[1] \"During the 1970s and 1980s, the top 5% of curators are exhibited 44% of the time.\"\n\n\n[1] \"During the 1950s and 1960s, the top 5% of curators are exhibited 40% of the time.\"\n\n\n[1] \"During the 1930s and 1940s, the top 5% of curators are exhibited 29% of the time.\"\n\nD. Number of Unique Exhibiting Curators at a Given Time\nThe figures below show the number of unique curators that were involved in\nexhibitions that began in each year and in each decade, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE. Directors and Department Heads\nIn addition to the Exhibition data, MoMA has also published a dataset listing information\nabout museum directors and department heads. These data contain information for 52\nunique individuals, 32 of whom are recorded to be involved in exhibitions in the Exhibition dataset.\nDirectors of the Museum do not always possess Exhibition Role in Press Relase of Director,\nand some of those who are listed as Directors in the Exhibition Role in Press Release\nare not Directors of the Museum in this dataset.\nF. Data Structure for Coarse-Grained Testing of Questions\nWe would like to receive data from MoMA on the curatorial teams for more recent years and the individual\nworks in their exhibitions, so that we can measure, among other things, the effect\nthat different curatorial teams have on different aspects of the exhibitions as\na collection of works.\nThese data can be restructured such that it provides us the same general framework\nat a coarser grained. Assuming the accuracy and completeness of the participants\nlisted for each exhibition, we have data on the composition of the curatorial teams\nfrom 1929-1989. In stead of all the works in each exhibition, we have the\nall the artists in each exhibition, which might be thought of as a coarser grained proxy\nof the works in the exhibition, to which comparable measures (artist’s average value of artwork,\nfrequency of artwork in exhibition) may be added as a proxy.\nGiven that some of these comparable measures could be obtained independent of MoMA\n(e.g., artist’s average value of frequency of artwork in exhibitions), it may be\npossible to begin preliminary exploration of our questions using these data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nThe MoMA dataset is likely the most complete available source for information on\nthe museum’s artwork, artists, and older exhibitions.\nThe dataset has information in most of the preliminary categories of information\nidentified for the project, particularly, institutions, artists, artowrks,\ncurators, supporters, older exhibitions, and dates.\nThe dataset, however, also lacks information in some of these preliminary categories of information:\nWhile the information on artworks and artists is current and regularly updated,\ninformation on exhibitions is only available for exhibitions that occurred in 1989\nor before.\nOutside of the department of a work, no further “collection” or subsample is\ngiven in the dataset as it is.\nThere is no information on ticket sales of exhibitions or their critical acclaim.\nAside from the credit lines attached to specific works, there is no information\nin the dataset on acts of donation.\nFew fields are 100% complete or standardized. These missing fields can pile up\n(v.s. below with curators). Even when information is available in the vast majority\nof cases, occasional gaps and errors will limit accuracy.\n1. Institutions\nThe data set gives information on a single institution: The Modern Museum of American Art (MoMA)\n2. Artists\nThe dataset includes a thorough (v.i.) listing of artists with artworks in the MoMA.\nFor most, the artist’s name, nationality, gender, birth year, and death year are\nin the data set.\n3. Artworks\nThe dataset includes a thorough listing of artworks in the MoMA. According todocumentation provided by the MoMA with the dataset, the Museum’s website contains around 98,000 records, whereas the dataset contains around 140,000.\nFor most artworks, the title of the work, the artist, the date, classification (painting, drawing, etc.),\nmedium (e.g. “Ink and cut-and-pasted painted pages on paper”), some form of dimensions,\ncredit line (e.g. Purchase; Gift of the architect in honor of Lily Auchincloss),\ndepartment and date of acquisition are avilable in the data set.\n4. Curators\nThere is someone listed in the role of curator for about 75% of the 1,735 exhibitions\nin the dataset. For most of these, a role as described in the press release are available\nin the data set.\nFor roughly half of these, nationality, gender, birth year, and death year are\navailable in the data set.\nFor a minority of these, senior titles at the museum and dates of tenure of those titles\nare available in the data set.\n\n\n\n5. Collections\nThe only subsample in the dataset as it is given is Department.\nOne could, based on other information in the dataset, create and describe\ncharacteristics of a subsample or “collection” of works, e.g. works by American artists.\n6. Supporters\nAbout 99% of artworks in the MoMA have a listed credit line. About 82% of these point\nto an individual donor or foundation. Examples of those that do not themselves point\nto an individual include “Purchase” or “Gift of the artist.”\nAbout half of credit lines pointing to individual donors or foundations have donated only\na single work. The top 10% of credit lines by most works in the museum account for\n65% of works in the museum.\nPercentiles: Works per Credit Line\n\n   0%   10%   20%   30%   40%   50%   60%   70%   80%   90%   95%   99%  100% \n    1     1     1     1     1     1     2     3     6    17    38   199 11256 \n\nBy taking information from works associated with the credit line, one is also able\nto find information on when and for how long a credit line was active.\n7. Exhibitions\nThe dataset provides a list of all MoMA exhibitions form 1929 to 1989. For most of these,\nthe title of the exhibition and the opening and closing dates are available.\nPeople and institutions involved in each exhibition, their roles (e.g. artists, curators, designers),\nand other information (v.s.) are available.\n8. Ticket Sales\nThe dataset contains no information on tickets sold by exhibitions.\n9. Critical Acclaim\nThe dataset contains no information on critical acclaim of exhibitions or other events.\n10. Dates\nThe following is a list of all dates available in the dataset:\nArtist Birth Year and Death Year\nYear of Creation of Artwork\nYear of Acquisition of Artwork\nOpening and Closing Date (MDY) of Exhibition\nBirth and Death Year of Entity involved in Exhibition\nStart and End Year of Tenure of Museum Directors and Department Heads\nBirth and Death Year of Museum Directors and Department Heads\n11. Donations\nOutside of the names of credit lines associated with specific works (v.s.), there\nis no information on specific contributions to the institution.\n\n\n\n",
